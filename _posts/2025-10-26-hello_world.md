Hello everyone,

This is **my first post ever** in my website. The idea here to *deliver you articles about side-projects* or *share something interesting that I learned* recently.

I am not the most skilled person in the world but this website has the objective of **motivating me** to **find new challenges**, **solve them**, **present my achievements** in a simple, chilled and friendly manner. I will ***not*** use a formal tone and I would like to remain myself during the writing process. Thus, sorry for anything !

> Please, keep in mind that I am doing this as a free time activity, chill out a bit ;) 

The idea of doing this websire is living in a head for several years now. At first, I was very inspired by the website of [Austin Morlan](https://austinmorlan.com/), specially his article about Pong. I discovered his page when I was looking for a project to do during summer, which I decided to clone Pong (it was terrible but it could write an article about it one day). After reading some of his articles, I thought: _"WOAW, this is great idea, I need to have this kind of web presence one day..., once I got the time."_. Now, I just started my phD and I have plenty of time to do side project. So, I finally decided to work on the website.

I would like to thank [RAHUL BOTHRA](https://rahulbothra.com/) for this _beautiful, clean, elegant and minimalist Jekyll theme_, [Parchment](https://github.com/rhl-bthr/parchment). Rahul, if you see this (probably not), **thank you** and I hope you don't mind the little changes I made.

If you don't know who I am, please check the [About Page]({{ page.about }}). I'll make a cute summary of who I am and what I am doing.

See you soon in the next article (if I am capable of finish one side-project). Maybe, we could talk about this blog and how I set it up.
